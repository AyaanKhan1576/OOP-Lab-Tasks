# OOP-Lab-Tasks

This repository contains Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) lab tasks implemented in C++ from FAST NUCES Islamabad (Spring 2023). Each task demonstrates fundamental OOP concepts and techniques.

## Introduction

This project is a collection of C++ programs for practicing Object-Oriented Programming concepts, including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more.

## Features

- Well-organized C++ source files for each lab task
- Code demonstrating OOP principles
- Beginner-friendly explanations (where applicable)
- Ready to compile and run

## Lab Tasks

The repository includes the following types of tasks:

- Basic class and object creation
- Inheritance and polymorphism examples
- Encapsulation and abstraction exercises
- Operator overloading
- File handling in C++
- Templates and exception handling

> **Note:** Please check individual folders/files for detailed problem statements and solutions.

## Getting Started
